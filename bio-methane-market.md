<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Methane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fermentation</li><li>Gasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biogas market primarily consists of two main processes: fermentation and gasification. Fermentation involves the anaerobic breakdown of organic materials, like agricultural waste or food scraps, resulting in biogas, primarily methane and carbon dioxide. This method is widely used for its efficiency in waste management. Conversely, gasification converts biomass into syngas through high-temperature processes in an oxygen-limited environment, producing a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane. Both methods contribute to renewable energy production and waste reduction strategies.</p></p>
