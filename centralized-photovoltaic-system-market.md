<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centralized Photovoltaic System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LCPV</li><li>HCPV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized photovoltaic systems are large-scale solar power installations that generate electricity by harnessing sunlight. The market is divided into two main types: Low Concentration Photovoltaics (LCPV) and High Concentration Photovoltaics (HCPV). LCPV uses lenses or mirrors to focus sunlight onto standard photovoltaic cells, achieving moderate efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In contrast, HCPV employs advanced optics to achieve higher concentrations of sunlight, requiring tracking systems and specialized cells for enhanced efficiency, but generally involves higher initial investment. Both markets cater to utility-scale energy production.</p></p>
