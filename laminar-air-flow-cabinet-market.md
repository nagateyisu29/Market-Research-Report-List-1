<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laminar Air Flow Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laminar Air Flow Cabinets are essential in laboratory settings to provide a contamination-free environment. They come in two main types: vertical and horizontal. Vertical laminar flow cabinets direct air downward from the top, offering better protection for the user and preventing contamination from falling particles. Horizontal cabinets, on the other hand, blow air horizontally across the workspace, ideal for applications where workspace depth is critical. Both types are designed to maintain sterile conditions, ensuring the integrity of sensitive experiments and processes.</p></p>
